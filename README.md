## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor


### What I learned

In this project I've learned to use some basic of preprocessor SASS and also how to use the basics of Grid CSS. And I've got better in how make responsives web pages.

### Continued development

With the development of this project I could notice that I had troubles to organize the SASS's files even with a architecture. Furthermore I still don't feel confortable with the HTML tags choseen because I don't know if thouse were the best for the SEO. So for the next project i intend to practice more these filds and update this project while I learn more about the topics quoted before.
